The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results due to issues with operator precedence or unit mismatch if not carefully constructed. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox layout might not subtract the 10px correctly if the parent element's size isn't fully determined yet.
